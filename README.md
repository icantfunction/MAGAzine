# Magazine Project

This project is a simple webpage for a fictional magazine. It's built with HTML and CSS, and it's designed to be responsive for different screen sizes.

## Files

The project consists of two main files:

1. `MAGAZine.html`: This is the main HTML file. It contains the structure and content of the webpage, including sections for the header, main text, and images.

2. `styles.css`: This is the CSS file. It contains the styles for the webpage, including typography, layout, and responsive design rules.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The webpage is designed to be viewed on a variety of devices with different screen sizes. It uses media queries to adjust the layout based on the viewport width.

- **Grid Layout**: The layout of the webpage is created using CSS Grid, providing a flexible way to arrange content into columns and rows.

- **Lazy Loading Images**: The images on the webpage use the `loading="lazy"` attribute to defer loading of images until they're in or near the viewport.

- **External Fonts and Icons**: The webpage uses Google Fonts for typography and Font Awesome for social media icons.

## Usage

To view the webpage, open the `MAGAZine.html` file in a web browser. The styles from the `styles.css` file will be applied automatically.
